PWA: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

Decription
I added functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application for offline access and functionality. The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they can populate the total when brought back online.

User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
